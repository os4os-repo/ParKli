# ParKli repository
The aim of the ParKli research project is to make the consequences of climate change on local natural and living spaces tangible through citizen science activities and to (further) develop local early warning systems for climate protection together with citizens.
By collecting, analysing and illustrating environmental data, local changes and correlations will be investigated. 

The ParKli services were developed step by step in a Co-creation process, and one of the questions was. 
How can the different data that is collected be visualised and analysed? <br>
For example, requirements were defined by the citizen scientists involved, which were implemented step by step by the ParKli team. 
One requirement was that users should not be concerned with aggregating and collating the data, but should instead focus on analysing it. 
Various APPs and sensors were used in ParKli to collect data. <br>

The artefacts developed are published in this repository. We are aware that it can be better organised, so we are constantly improving our documentation. If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact us.

The ParKli research project is funded by the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg
Foundation in the program "Innovations for Adaptation to Climate Change".

## Overview

This repository consists of three parts:

* **IoT-stack**: A combination of containers that together make it possible to receive, process and visualise sensor data
* **dashBoards**: A Python application with which sensor data from different platforms and sources can be displayed in a predefined layout
* **databaseUpdate**: A tool with which the environmental data of the dashboard can be automatically updated by synchronising the dashboard database with common data sources [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/)
